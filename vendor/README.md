# Vendored dependencies

I vendor each dependency so that if you don't have an internet connection or if `crates.io` is down, you can still compile and run the code just fine.

The following dependencies are vendored at this time:

* [snap v1.0.2](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy/releases/tag/1.0.2)
